# GiphyShare

#### A lightweight app that makes saving and sharing GIFs easy

## Description
Created for UT Bootcamp, week 6 homework. We were tasked with using the Giphy API to perform AJAX calls and display data on a page.

## Theme/Exploration
Rather than simply displaying GIFs on a page, I wanted to create a cohesive application that had some functionality for the user. I took the approach of adding a couple features that make the application more useful. First, simple share buttons,allowing users to share images with their friends. Second, I added the ability to favorite GIFs, storing them in the user's Local Storage.
